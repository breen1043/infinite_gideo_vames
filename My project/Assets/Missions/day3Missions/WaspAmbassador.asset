  Title: Wasp Ambassador
  Description: "President Comb, the wasp colony seems like they want to\u2026 ally
    with us? This chance is one in a buzz-illion. We must showcase our ways of life,
    and how similar we truly are. A traditional dance, perhaps? But the wasps are
    notoriously swift\u2026"
