  Title: Beegally Blonde
  Description: "Madam President, a local cricket troupe has invited some of our hive
    to their performance of Beegally Blonde! (In hindsight, it only makes sense that
    we were invited\u2026) Let's send our best dancers. Of course, they should work
    well with others."
