  Title: Something Horrible
  Description: "Those ants near the water\u2026 Something horrible has happened to
    them. The mushrooms have.. overtaken them? Now they shamble about aimlessly,
    spreading spores. Please, Madam President, we must stop them. A united, strong
    front might end this."
